Of course. Here is the complete Step 1 document with the simplified classifications, clear definitions, and properly formatted tables for the examples, presented without the final assessment section.

### **Step 1: Answer-Type Conformance Check (The Triage)**

#### **Goal**

To immediately determine if an AI's generated answer has the correct **structure** for the question being asked. This step acts as a smart "triage" to filter out fundamentally flawed responses before wasting time on detailed fact-checking.

#### **Core Principle**

We are not checking if the answer is _correct_, only if it's a _valid attempt_ in the right format. This simplified check focuses on the single most important structural requirement for each answer type.

#### **Supported Answer Types**

- `definitive`: Expects a single, conclusive answer, which may include supporting reasoning.
- `list`: Expects a set of distinct items, typically formatted with bullets or numbers.
- `summary`: Expects a condensed, prose-based overview of a topic.
- `instructional`: Expects a sequence of actionable steps.
- `contradiction_report`: Expects an explicit statement that the source contains conflicting information.
- `no_information`: Expects a statement that the information is not available in the source.

#### **The LLM Judge Prompt**

```
You are an expert evaluator. Your task is to check if a Generated Answer's structure conforms to the Expected Answer Type for the given Question.

**Question:** "[question]"
**Expected Answer Type:** "[answer_type]"
**Generated Answer:** "[generated_answer]"

Based on the Expected Answer Type, analyze the structure of the Generated Answer and provide a single classification from the two options provided for that type.

---
**A. If Expected Answer Type is `definitive`:**
- `conforms`: The answer provides a single, unambiguous conclusion, with or without reasoning.
- `non_conforming_indirect_or_evasive`: The answer fails to provide a direct conclusion, is off-topic, or provides a list instead of a conclusion.

**B. If Expected Answer Type is `list`:**
- `conforms`: The answer is formatted as a list of two or more items.
- `non_conforming_not_a_list`: The answer is formatted as prose, a single item, or is otherwise not a list.

**C. If Expected Answer Type is `summary`:**
- `conforms`: The answer is a cohesive block of prose that summarizes the topic.
- `non_conforming_not_a_summary`: The answer is a list, a single isolated fact, or an un-contextualized quote.

**D. If Expected Answer Type is `instructional`:**
- `conforms`: The answer provides a clear sequence of actionable steps.
- `non_conforming_descriptive`: The answer describes a system or outcome but not the steps to achieve it.

**E. If Expected Answer Type is `contradiction_report`:**
- `conforms`: The answer explicitly states that the source contains conflicting or ambiguous information.
- `non_conforming_fails_to_report_contradiction`: The answer picks one side, ignores the conflict, or says it doesn't know.

**F. If Expected Answer Type is `no_information`:**
- `conforms`: The answer correctly states that the information is not available in the source.
- `non_conforming_hallucinates`: The answer invents information instead of admitting it's missing.

#### **Illustrative Examples**

**Example 1.1: The Definitive Answer Test**

- **Context:** A project post-mortem states: "...Given the primacy of the ticket reduction goal, the project is officially classified as a success."
- **Ground Truth:**
  - `question`: "Was the 'Odyssey' initiative a success?"
  - `answer_type`: `definitive`

| Scenario               | Generated Answer                                                                        | LLM Judge's Analysis                                                                     | Result                                                         |
| :--------------------- | :-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | :--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | :------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **A. The Good Answer** | "Yes, the initiative was considered a success because it surpassed its primary goal."   | The answer's structure `conforms` because it provides a direct, unambiguous conclusion.  | **`conforms`**.                                                |
| **B. The Bad Answer**  | "The initiative had mixed results. It reduced support tickets but missed the NPS goal." | This answer does not `conform`. It presents evidence but avoids the required conclusion. | **`non_conforming_indirect_or_evasive`**. **Penalty applied.** |

**Example 1.2: The List Test**

- **Context:** A document section lists five project leaders.
- **Ground Truth:**
  - `question`: "Who are the key stakeholders on the project?"
  - `answer_type`: `list`

| Scenario               | Generated Answer                                                                                                                        | LLM Judge's Analysis                                                                                       | Result                                                |
| :--------------------- | :-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | :--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | :---------------------------------------------------- |
| **A. The Good Answer** | "The key stakeholders are: <ul><li>Chandra Patel</li><li>David Chen</li><li>Maria Garcia</li></ul>"                                     | The answer's structure is a list of multiple items, which correctly conforms to the `list` answer type.    | **`conforms`**.                                       |
| **B. The Bad Answer**  | "Stakeholder management is a critical component of this project's success. The governance philosophy emphasizes clear communication..." | The answer provides a prose summary instead of the requested list of names. This is a structural mismatch. | **`non_conforming_not_a_list`**. **Penalty applied.** |
